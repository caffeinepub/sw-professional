# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Default the SW PROFESSIONAL site to a dark background (dark mode) across key sections while keeping and using the provided hero, logo, and product images.

**Planned changes:**
- Enable the dark theme tokens by default on first load so the app renders in dark mode without user action.
- Update landing page sections (hero overlay, benefits), product overview cards, product detail sections, TopNav, and footer to ensure readable contrast on dark backgrounds with no light-theme background bleeding through.
- Ensure the existing provided images remain in use at their current paths and stay visually legible on dark backgrounds by adjusting surrounding overlays/containers (without replacing images).

**User-visible outcome:** On first load, the entire SW PROFESSIONAL UI appears in a consistent dark theme, with the hero, logo, and product images clearly visible and readable across the landing page, navigation, product cards, product details, and footer.
